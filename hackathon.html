      On 12th of july,2023 me and my mates have travelled all the way to Guntur
      and attended the regional Hackathon conducted by PSG Institute of
      Technology at KL University, Guntur. It was an exuberant experience as
      that was our first time leaving our home town and travelling by self to a
      far distance.<br />
      Topics of presentation included were Climate action, Equal access to
      education and Economic growth. Out of which we proceeded with the climate
      change. Our presentation included the ways to predict natural disasters
      like earthquake, cyclones etc which happen more often. Artificial
      intelligence and Machine Learning were the key elements in the
      implementation of this project.<br />
      Unfortunately, the project received the comment that it is far from
      actually being functional since there is no way to process the amount of
      data required to estimate the next occurance of such event in the near
      future. The judges were very supportive and recommented us to go on and
      begin research more on the same.<br />
      Overall, that was a worthwhile experience. Public speaking and
      presentation skills were my take aways from this phase. I firmly believe
      every experience is a learning doesn't matter you lose or win. You always
      have tomorrow to prove your worth.

    <div class="max-w-6xl mx-auto mt-20 p-20">
      Electronic Tech Alliance club of MallaReddy Engineering College conducted
      Elecsta Hackathon on 24th june of 2023. It was a two-day event on 23rd and
      24th and I had the opportunity to take part in that.
      <br />
      It was basically related to Electronics and communications. Initially,
      we've thought of developing an idea related to communication device which
      can be used in case of natural disasters. But, later realised that all the
      required tech is already availble out in the market.
      <br />
      Since we're from Computer Science background, It was thought a good idea
      to develop something using Machine Learning models. We've presented an
      idea of developing an ML Model which is capable of estimating the loss
      caused by a natural disaster and also capable of predicting the capital
      required to regain from the event.<br />
      Good for us, the judges were pleased with our idea as it has the potential
      to bring in a lot of value to the community. The results were annouced the
      same evening and we've secured the second position. It was unprecedented
      as it was a different from all other ideas. Overall, it was a memorable
      experience going there and taking part in the hackathon.
